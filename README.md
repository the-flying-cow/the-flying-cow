  🐍 Proficient in Python for data analysis, scripting, backend development, and building automation testing frameworks to boost software quality
  ⚙️ Strong knowledge of C for system-level programming and low-level algorithm design
  ☕ Basic knowledge of Java, currently sharpening my object-oriented programming and app development skills
  🧠 Familiar with both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, from model training to evaluation and deployment
  🔧 Experienced with Git & GitHub for version control, team collaboration, and CI/CD practices
  🧪 Comfortable using Python to build testing and automation tools for streamlining development workflows
  
-🌱 Currently diving deeper into Python, Vim, and advanced ML concepts to level up my workflow and project capabilities.
